# nextWordPred-LSTM

An LSTM-based Next Word Prediction Model

## Overview

`nextWordPred-LSTM` is a deep learning project that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict the next word in a sequence of text. This repository is designed for exploring sequence modeling in natural language processing and can be used for tasks like text generation or auto-completion.

## Features

- LSTM-based architecture for sequential data modeling
- Configurable hyperparameters
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Sample dataset and preprocessing utilities
- Extensible for custom datasets

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (choose based on your implementation)
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UDLHS/nextWordPred-LSTM.git
cd nextWordPred-LSTM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### Training

Prepare your dataset and start training:

```bash
python train.py --data_path data/input.txt --epochs 10 --batch_size 64
```

#### Prediction

Use the trained model to predict the next word:

```bash
python predict.py --model_path models/best_model.pt --seed_text "The quick brown"
```

### Configuration

You can adjust model and training parameters in the config file or via command-line arguments.

## Dataset

Sample data is provided in the `data/` folder. You can use your own text dataset by placing it in the same directory and updating the path in your scripts.
